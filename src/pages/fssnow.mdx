const FullscreenSnow = withNeon(Empty, effect);

### Full Screen Example

<FullscreenSnow />

React Neon fullscreen effects by passing an option of 'fullscreen' that's set to true. This will attach the effect to the top left of the screen and set it's dimensions to match the page.

In the example code below an empty div has been passed in for the ResizeObserver to listen to, but the effect could be attached to a real component in a proper app or website.

### Example Code

```javascript
  import withNeon, { fx } from "react-neon";
  const Empty = () => (<div />);
  const effect = new fx.Snow({ fullscreen: true });
  const FullscreenSnow = withNeon(Empty, effect);
```
