### Quick Start Guide

[Using Neon in a bundle](#bundle)  
[Using Neon from a CDN](#browser)

#### <a name="bundle"></a> Using Neon in a bundle

To get started with React Neon you need a React component to wrap with a Neon layer. If you don't have any knowledge of React then [the React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) is the place to start.

A Neon layer is a React High Order Component that returns the component that's passed in along with a new `<canvas />` that's set up to sit in the same position on the page as the component. The canvas is initialised in either 2d or WebGL mode, and a draw() callback is repeatedly called using requestAnimationFrame() to draw to it.

The drawing itself is done by a Neon effect plugin. React Neon comes with a bundle of pre-defined effects, but the idea really is that you'll write your own.

#### Installing React Neon from NPM

If you started your React app with `create-react-app` or if you're building your site with a bundler such as Webpack or Parcel, then you should install React Neon using npm;

`npm install react-neon`

#### Importing React Neon

Once React Neon has finished installing you can import it and its effects bundle in to your app where you want to wrap your component.

```javascript
import withNeon, { fx } from 'react-neon';
```

Now that Neon is available in the component it's time to use it.

#### Initialising an effect

To use an effect you need to initial it first. For the effects in the fx library included with React Neon this is a matter of instantiating a new effect object. For example, if you wanted to use the Neon effect you'd need to use;

`const effect = new fx.Neon();`

Some effects take parameters in the form of an object that's passed in when they're instantiated. To create a Neon effect with a size of 10px you need to pass in an object with a property of 'size' set to 10;

`const effect = new fx.Neon({ size: 10 });`

If you want to create your own effect you should look at the Creating Effects page.

#### Exporting your component with an effect

React Neon works the same way as any other HoC (High Order Component). You need to export withNeon() with your component and the effect you're using as parameters.

```javascript
import react from 'react';
import withNeon, { fx } from 'react-neon';

const myComponent = () => ( <div>My Component</div> );
const effect = new fx.Neon({ size: 10 });

// export myComponent;
export default withNeon(myComponent, effect);
```

That's really all there is to a basic effect.

#### <a name="browser"></a> Loading Neon from a CDN

If you're not using a bundler then you can still use React Neon by loading the UMD or Babel bundle from a CDN.

```html
<script>https://unpkg.com/react-neon@0.4.5/dist/index.umd.js</script>
```

When you load from a CDN using the UMD bundle React Neon uses a `neon` namespace so it doesn't clash with any other code. Consequently you need to prefix any Neon calls with `neon.`. Also, as withNeon is the default export from the package it's called neon.default instead of neon.withNeon. This may be fixed in a future version.

```javascript

const myComponent = () => ( <div>My Component</div> );
const effect = new neon.fx.Neon({ size: 10 });

// export myComponent;
export default neon.default(myComponent, effect);
```

For an example of using React Neon in a browser loading from a CDN see [React Neon Example - Fuzz](https://codepen.io/onion2k/pen/rqBwBM) on Codepen.
