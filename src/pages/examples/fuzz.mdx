### Effects / Fuzz

Make a component fuzzy by adding hairs around the outside.

Fuzz listens to the mouse and moves hairs when the mouse is nearby, and to the scroll position to make the hairs move when the user scrolls.

### Options

| Option  | What it does |
|---|---|
| padding | Distance to draw outside of the component in pixels |
| size | The size of hairs in pixels |

### Example

<Fuzz />

### Example Code

```javascript
import Tile from "../../components/Tile.js";
import withNeon, { fx } from "react-neon";
const effect = new fx.Fuzz({ size: 50, padding: 50 });
effect.listenMouse().listenScroll();
const Fuzz = withNeon(Tile, effect);
```
