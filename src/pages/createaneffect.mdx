### Create An Effect



#### Webpack compatibility

By default Webpack isn't set up to compile code from node_modules. Consequently creating an effect that extends the Fx base class doesn't work. In order to resolve this React Neon includes a babel build of the code that can be used as the basis of your effect in its dist directory.

`import { Fx } from 'react-neon/dist/index.babel.js'`
